# Example 1 - Tween and Keyframes

## What the example does
This example is done to explore how the animations of Tween and Keyframes work in the context of shifting the position of objects. 

Tween allows to animate the objects between two positions either by expanding or decreasing the size of the object or by by rotating the object between two positions.  

Keyframes allow to animate the object between four positions and shift colours during animation is running. 

## Why the example is useful  
These animations could be used in creating basic animations in browser and Node

## How users can get started with the example
The code needs the [Popmotion pure library](https://popmotion.io/learn/install/) in order to work, as well as a JavaScript editor. The code consists of animating DOM elements by using tween and keyframe functions.
