# What the project does 

This is an example of an input field for a username. Popmotion library is used to highlight the counter ticking down/up, giving the user a visual cue when minimal required characters have been input. 

Running the code gives an input field with a counter. The counter reacts to the characters being written. As of now, no other function is implemented other than the one described above.

# Why the project is useful
The project aims to showcase some potential uses for an input field and how the user can get notified that the username has reached minimum criteria. Interaction between the user and object can be further developed. Experimentation can be made by using the "spring"-function to make the counter more visible or the frame could be made more visually noticeable when typing a user name.

# How users can get started with the project
The code needs the [Popmotion pure library](https://popmotion.io/learn/install/) in order to work. 
Repository with the code and other examples is found on: [https://github.com/karinOllermark/API-Lab-8](https://github.com/karinOllermark/API-Lab-8)

# Where users can get help with your project
Other than google as resource, Popmotion pure has a [learn](https://popmotion.io/learn/get-started/) section where technical aspects of the library are covered. There is also an [official community](https://spectrum.chat/popmotion/?tab=posts) where users can ask questions and contribute with knowledge.

# Who maintains and contributes to the project
Miroslav Banusic made the example out of a existing template from the Popmotion website. [link](https://popmotion.io/learn/spring-loaded-characters-remaining/). As of 28/2/2020 The project isn't being maintained anymore.
