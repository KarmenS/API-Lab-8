# What the project does 

This is an example of a input field for a username. Popmotion library is used to highlight the counter ticking down, giving the user a visual cue when minimal required characters have been input. 

Running the code gives an input field with a counter. The counter reacts to the characters being written. As of now no other function is implemented other than the one described above.

# Why the project is useful
The project aims to showcase some potential uses for an input field and how the user can get notified that the username has reached minimum criteria. Further experimentation can be made by using the "spring"-function to make the counter more visible. 

# How users can get started with the project
The code needs the [Popmotion pure](https://popmotion.io/pure/) library in order to work. 

# Where users can get help with your project
Other than google as resource, Popmotion pure has a [learn](https://popmotion.io/learn/get-started/)section where technical aspects of the library are covered. There is also an [official community](https://spectrum.chat/popmotion/?tab=posts) where users can ask questions and contribute. 

# Who maintains and contributes to the project
Miroslav Banusic made the example out of a existing example from the [website](https://popmotion.io/learn/spring-loaded-characters-remaining/). As of 28/2/2020 The example isn't being maintained anymore.
