## What the project does
Popmotion is a collection of simple libraries for delightful interfaces. Popmotion Pure is a functional and flexible JavaScript library for animators and UI developers. 
The animations are created by animating DOM elements.

Our project is experimenting with some of the examples from Popmotion Pure (https://popmotion.io/pure/). Descriptions of the specific examples we extended can be found in their respective README files. 

## Why the project is useful
Animation could be used to enhance interaction for example in sign-up flows and other gui elements. It can be used to make animations, interactive elements as well as just add a more interesting twist to the visual aspect of interfaces. It can serve as a feedforward for some functionalities. It can also offer a playful form of feedback after performing actions. 

## How users can get started with the project
The code needs the [Popmotion pure library](https://popmotion.io/learn/install/) in order to work, as well as a JavaScript editor.
