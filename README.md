## What the project does
Popmotion is an advanced functional JavaScript animation library. Can be used also to make reactive animations. 
The animations are created by animating DOM elements


## Why the project is useful
Animation could be used to enhance interaction for example in sign-up flows and other gui elements (bring examples maybe?)


## How users can get started with the project
The code needs the [Popmotion pure library](https://popmotion.io/learn/install/) in order to work as well as a (any) JavaScript environment.
Repository with the code and other examples is found on: [https://github.com/karinOllermark/API-Lab-8](https://github.com/karinOllermark/API-Lab-8)
