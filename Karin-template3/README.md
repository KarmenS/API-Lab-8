# Example 3 - spring (showed on presentation)
This is an example with spring and listen done by Karin Ollermark

listen: https://popmotion.io/api/listen/

## spring animation
Spring animation offers smooth motion and a great variety of spring-feels, based on stiffness, mass and damping.

## What I experimented
I wanted to experiment more with the spring animation from Karin-template2 to see how to use spring in another context. So I wanted to try a sign-up page, but it can hover be added to many other contexts. This example wanted to experiment with feedforward and to make the page more "alive" and interesting.

I added new values to the spring animation so that both the headline and form went in from opposite side and met in the middle.

Then I added the listener to be able to hover over the button. For when the mouse enter the button I set the scale from 1 to 1.2 so it would get bigger and then did the opposite (from 1.2 to 1) to when the mouse exit the button.
