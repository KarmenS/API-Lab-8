## Interactive text
This is an extension of the Keyframes example (https://popmotion.io/api/keyframes/).

The text is made interactive by having several event listeners added to some of the DOM elements. All interactions are triggered by hovering in this example. Some animations are active from the begining, looping infinitely. The 'keyframes' function is used to change: the color, the location, the position and the scale of the selected elements. 

# Potential uses, benefits
The html elements 'gain more life' when the events are triggered, which can serve several purposes. 

The heading grows in size and changes its color to simply attract more attention and highlight its importance. The animation can support the hierarchy of information.

The word "accumsan" receives a colorful background and stays highlighted to be easily found and come back to even in a big body of text. It can represent a keyword that needs to be remembered, or describes the theme of the paragraph. This changes the hierarchy of information as well. 

The words "Nulla facilisi" start in an upside-down position, requiring an action to become readable. By putting a little bit of extra effort into reading this information, it is more likely that the words will receive extra attention and will be remembered for longer. 

The word "pharetra", that travels to the colorful shapes from the text, represents an information that can show a connection between two elements that are not placed next to each other. It could be a description of a picture, which is also talked about in the main text, for example. It only needs to be shown in one place then, and can travel to the other place when necessary. This can offer more white space and lessen the load of information. 

These interactions can be useful for example in a learning setting, or wherever the users are desired to engage more with the content.
