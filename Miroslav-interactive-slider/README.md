# Example - interactive slider
This is an example of an interactive slider. 

The example is based on Constrained motion. https://popmotion.io/learn/constrain-motion/  
Within that field, the example page brings up two different functions to restrict range of motion: Hard clamp and spring back.


## What I experimented 
Experimenting with the slider and code, we can create different reactions to it. One example is with the "hard clamp" and basically it works as any other slider on the web. It has an fixed range of motion.
The other function I played around with was "spring back". What it does is that it gives the slider a little bounce back and thus gives it a pleasant visual feel. How much bounce depends on where and what type of function the slider is connected to.
