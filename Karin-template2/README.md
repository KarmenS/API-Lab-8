# Example 2 - spring
This is an example with spring and listen done by Karin Ollermark

listen: https://popmotion.io/api/listen/

## spring animation
Spring animation offers smooth motion and a great variety of spring-feels, based on stiffness, mass and damping.

## Pointer
Pointer outputs the screen position of a single mouse or touch point.

## What I experimented
I wanted to see how the different props and values changed what happens with the bubble. So the first two (ball 1 and 2) I experimented the stiffness and damping to see how it changed the movement of the two balls, so one(green) could be slower and get to position directly. The other one (pink) came back quicker but bounced around to get to position. 

For the third(blue) I skipped the listen input to see what can be done without the interaction with the mouse. So then it basically moved between two positions that I added.
