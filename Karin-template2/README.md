# Example 2 - spring
This is an example with spring and listen done by Karin Ollermark

listen: https://popmotion.io/api/listen/

## What I experimented
I wanted to see how the different props and values changed what happens with the bubble. So the first two (ball 1 and 2) I experimented the stiffness and damping to see how it changed the movement of the two balls, so one(green) could be slower and get to position at first. The other one (pink) came back quicker but bounced around to get to position. 

For the third(blue) I skipped the listen input to see what can be done without the interaction with the mouse. So then it basically when from one place to another
