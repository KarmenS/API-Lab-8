# Example 3- Tween 

## What the example does
This projects explores further the tween animations by showing how the tween animation could be implemented in the context of creating visual hierarchy. In this example animations were added to a wireframe.

Tween allows to animate the objects between two positions either by expanding or decreasing the size of the object or by moving it from one location to another in the same size. 

## Why the example is useful
In this context the animations can be used to guide the observers attention by variating the pace and timing of the motions. These animations could be implemented for example in a web page where there is a need for a feedforward to guide the observers attention. 


## How users can get started with the example
The code needs the [Popmotion pure library](https://popmotion.io/learn/install/) in order to work, as well as a JavaScript editor.  The code consists of animating DOM elements by using tween functions.
