# Example 1 - pointer
This is an example with pointer and listen done by Karin Ollermark 

pointer: https://popmotion.io/api/pointer/
listen: https://popmotion.io/api/listen/

## Pointer
Pointer outputs the screen position of a single mouse or touch point.

## What I experimented
This example started out with a ball that you could drag around the screen. When you pressed the mouse down you could drag it around the screen and when you let go of the mouse (mouseup) it stayed put on the screen.

I change appearance from ball to a rectangle. 

First I started to change values so the box would be at x:50 and y:50, and then I changed the mouse action from mouse down to mouse hover.
