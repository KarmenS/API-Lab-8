## What I explored
My example explores another way to show responses to different questions through having a slider adjust the expression of a face linking to how a person perceives a question. It was an attempt to visualize the idea of surveying people through a numbered ranking. This could be implemented in any kind of survey that would otherwise use a numbered system to collect data about how people feel about a subject . In this example the subject would be the weekend.
