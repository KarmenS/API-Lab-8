# Example - Text field
This is an example of an Text field. 

The example is based on several different functions of the library. More info on: https://popmotion.io/learn/spring-loaded-characters-remaining/



## What I experimented 
This was an interesting example to play around with. Key focus was to test out interactive ways in which the user can be notified of remaining characters. In this project several components and functions are used in order to have a running example. This is the "Minimalistic/scaled down" version. I choose to explore this example further. More on that example [here](https://github.com/karinOllermark/API-Lab-8/tree/master/Miroslav-text-field%20Highligth)
