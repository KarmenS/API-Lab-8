# Example 2 - Pointer, Velocity & Physics, Spring

## What the example does
This example is done to explore different pointer tracking animations that react to mouse click and mouse movement.

Pointer function allows to move the objects freely in the created space when pressing the mouse and stops the moving process once mouse is released.

Velocity and physics function also allows to move the object in the created space and adds inertia to the moved animation that is dependent on the speed of mouse movement until it stops itself. 

Spring function restricts the object to one place and allows the object to be moved with mouse press and dragged to any direction and then returns the object to the original restricted position.

## Why the example is useful
These examples could be used to create interactive animations in browsers that react to different mouse inputs.

## How users can get started with the example
The code needs the [Popmotion pure library](https://popmotion.io/learn/install/) in order to work, as well as a JavaScript editor. The code consists of animating DOM elements by using pointer function, velocity & physics function and a spring function
